% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as

% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks

\author{陈邵杰,郭昊,蔡明珠,刘政,黄俊毅,王晶昊,杨双菁,田睿朴,苗馨月% <-this % stops a space
\thanks{感谢电子科技大学机器学习课程闫老师与张老师的教学。}% <-this % stops a space
\thanks{2024年10月}}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
随着人工智能的发展和交通安全需求的增加，基于深度学习的目标检测技术在行人头盔佩戴检测中发挥着重要用。在本研究中，针对行人检测场景采用YOLOv8l模型进行头盔检测，并通过稀疏化和剪枝技术对模型进行优化，在高精度的同时提升推理效率。利用稀疏化方法对YOLOv8l模型的权重进行优化，增强模型的稀疏性，减少计算冗余。通过剪枝技术有效去除冗余的网络参数和连接，大幅减少模型的计算量和参数规模，优化后的模型在嵌入式和边缘计算设备上运行效率显著提升。实验结果表明，经过稀疏化和剪枝后的YOLOv8l模型参数量减少了约30\%，推理速度提高了近40\%，并且在行人头盔检测任务中维持了高达98\%的准确率。我们还将优化后的模型与YOLOv3、YOLOv5、YOLOv7等多个版本进行了对比，验证了YOLOv8l在行人检测精度和速度方面的优势。
